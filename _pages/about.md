[quick life update] I've recently joined Amazon in Seattle, WA as an Applied Scientist.

I obtained my Ph.D. at The Ohio State University's department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, under the supervision of [Prof. Yingbin Liang](https://sites.google.com/view/yingbinliang/home). 
Before joining OSU, I obtained my M.Sc. in Machine Learning and Intelligent Systems at 
Beijing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics (Beihang University), and did my undergraduate studies in Electrical Engineering at Ecole Polytechnique de Thies, Senegal. 

## Research 
My research interests are mainly about optimization methods for modern Machine Learning (ML), robust ML, and Deep Learning Theory. 
On the theoretical side, I am interested in building new frameworks, especially through the lens of bilevel optimization, 
that capture modern ML applications such as Meta Learning, Adversarial Training, Hyperparameter Optimization, etc. 
On the practical side, I aim to design new algorithms with provable guarantees to tackle these problems as well as develop their practical and efficient implementations. 
More recently, I mainly focus on optimization for task-specific adaptation of large language models (LLMs), either via direct finetuning of the parameters (when access is allowed) or optimizing the instructions for blackbox LLMs. 
I'm affiliated with the [NSF AI Institute for Future Edge Networks and Distributed Intelligence (AI-EDGE)](https://aiedge.osu.edu/).
