I'm a Ph.D. student at The Ohio State University's department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, under the supervision of by [Prof. Yingbin Liang](https://sites.google.com/view/yingbinliang/home). 
Before joining OSU, I obtained my M.Sc. in Pattern Recognition and Intelligent Systems at 
Beijing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics (Beihang University), and did my undergraduate studies at Ecole Polytechnique de Thies, Senegal. 

## Research 
My research interests are mainly about optimization methods for modern Machine Learning (ML), robust ML, and Deep Learning Theory. 
On the theoretical side, I am interested in building new frameworks, especially through the lens of bilevel optimization, 
that capture modern ML applications such as Meta Learning, Adversarial Training, Hyperparameter Optimization, etc. 
On the practical side, I aim to design new algorithms with provable guarantees to tackle these problems as well as develop their practical and efficient implementations. 
I'm affiliated with the [NSF AI Institute for Future Edge Networks and Distributed Intelligence (AI-EDGE)](https://aiedge.osu.edu/). 

## News 

[//]: # (August 2023 - started here)
- Will be joining Amazon.com, Inc. in Seattle as a Research Scientist intern this coming November!  


- New preprint: [Doubly Robust Instance-Reweighted Adversarial Training](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.00311). We propose a novel doubly robust instance reweighted adversarial training framework based on Distributionally Robust Optimization (DRO). 


- Gave an invited talk in the session ‚ÄúBilevel Stochastic Methods for Optimization and Learning‚Äù at the 2022 INFORMS Annual Meeting, Indianapolis, IN.
